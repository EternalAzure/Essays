## Network Externalities
The more people use a typical network, the more <br>
valuable it becomes.
- First, the value of a product to a user depends on<br>
how many other users adopt it.
- Second, technology often has high fixed costs and<br>
low marginal costs.
- Third, there are often large costs to users from<br>
switching technologies, which leads to lock-in.

All three of these effects tend to lead to ”winner<br>
take all” market structures with dominant firms. So<br>
it is extremely important to get into markets quickly<br>
the marginal cost of production (which in the case<br>
of information is zero). So businesses need ways<br>
of selling on value rather than on cost.<br>

The huge first-mover advantages that can arise<br>
in economic systems with strong positive feedback are<br>
the origin of the so-called “Microsoft philosophy” of<br>
‘we’ll ship it on Tuesday and get it right by version 3’. 

Network economics has many other effects on security engineering. <br>
Rather than using a standard, well<br>
analyzed and tested architecture, companies often go<br>
for a proprietary obscure one – to increase customer<br>
lock-in and increase the investment that competitors<br>
have to make to create compatible products.<br>

## Distinguishing Good From Bad
Why is it that, even in relatively <br>
competitive  security product markets, <br>
the bad products tend to drive out the good?<br>
The theory of asymmetric information gives us an<br>
explanation of one of the mechanisms. Consider a used<br>
car market, on which there are 100 good cars (the<br>
‘plums’), worth $3000 each, and 100 rather <br>
troublesome ones (the ‘lemons’), each of which is worth only<br>
$1000. The vendors know which is which, but the<br>
buyers don’t. So what will be the equilibrium price of<br>
used cars?<br>

If customers start off believing that the probability<br>
they will get a plum is equal to the probability they<br>
will get a lemon, then the market price will start off<br>
at $2000. However, at that price only lemons will be<br>
offered for sale, and once the buyers observe this, the<br>
price will drop rapidly to $1000 with no plums being<br>
sold at all. In other words, when buyers don’t have as<br>
much information about the quality of the products<br>
as sellers do, there will be severe downward pressure<br>
on both price and quality. Infosec people frequently<br>
complain about this in many markets for the products <br>
and components we use; the above insight, due<br>
to Akerlof, explains why it happens<br>

The problem of bad products driving out good ones<br>
can be made even worse when the people evaluating <br>
them aren’t the people who suffer when they fail.<br>
Much has been written on the ways in which corporate <br>
performance can be adversely affected when executives <br>
have incentives at odds with the welfare of their<br>
employer. For example, managers often buy products<br>
and services which they know to be suboptimal or even<br>
defective, but which are from big name suppliers. This<br>
is known to minimize the likelihood of getting fired<br>
when things go wrong. Corporate lawyers don’t condemn <br>
this as fraud, but praise it as ‘due diligence’.<br>
Over the last decade of the twentieth century, many<br>
businesses have sought to fix this problem by extending<br> 
stock options to ever more employees. However,<br>
these incentives don’t appear to be enough to ensure<br>
prudent practice by security managers.<br>

## Conclusion
Much has been written on the failure of information <br>
security mechanisms to protect end users from<br>
privacy violations and fraud. This misses the point.<br>
The real driving forces behind security system design<br>
usually have nothing to do with such altruistic goals.<br>
They are much more likely to be the desire to grab a<br>
monopoly, to charge different prices to different users<br>
for essentially the same service, and to dump risk. Often<br>
this is perfectly rational.
