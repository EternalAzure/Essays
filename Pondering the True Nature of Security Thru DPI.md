# Pondering the True Nature of Security Thru DPI

Deep packet inspection is the act of reading ins and outs of the packets both arriving and leaving. One analogy is, if packet inspection is reading the title of a book, deep packet inspection is reading the whole thing. This means accessing header and data of the packet. I wonder if it's same as response/request objects in programming. This usually happens on firewall level. For what I understood this means routers and or modems.
Inspection techniques are but not limited to Pattern or signature matching, Protocol anomaly and IPS solutions.

Use cases listed by Digital Guardian: Weeding out any non-compliance to protocol, spam, viruses, intrusions, and any other defined criteria to block the packet from passing through the inspection point. DPI is sold as a valuable service often bundled with other services like VPN, malware analysis, antispam filtering, URL filtering, and other technologies.
DPI can also help us to prevent data leaks by monitoring leaving traffic. Monitoring can stop top sneaky files from being send out without sufficient clearance. But if we see security as one use case in its entirety, then we can see the real divide here is between security and control.

Digital Guarding tells us about Chinese government eaves dropping and censorship. But what makes private service providers more reliable than Chinese government? They can sell our data to the highest bidder. Maybe it's not about placing our trust in the right hands, but rather balancing between right ratio of trust. We can purchase all our security solutions from one vendor or one nation state. But if they turn against us even the heavens can't save us. Then again using several vendors means needing to trust multiple agents.
