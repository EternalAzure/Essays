## Network Externalities
The more people use a typical network, the more
valuable it becomes. The more people use the phone
system – or the Internet – more people there are to
- First, the value of a product to a user depends on
how many other users adopt it.
- Second, technology often has high fixed costs and
low marginal costs.
- Third, there are often large costs to users from
switching technologies, which leads to lock-in.

All three of these effects tend to lead to ”winner
take all” market structures with dominant firms. So
it is extremely important to get into markets quickly
the marginal cost of production (which in the case
of information is zero). So businesses need ways
of selling on value rather than on cost.

The huge first-mover advantages that can arise
in economic systems with strong positive feedback are
the origin of the so-called “Microsoft philosophy” of
‘we’ll ship it on Tuesday and get it right by version
3’. 

Network economics has many other effects on security engineering. 
Rather than using a standard, well
analyzed and tested architecture, companies often go
for a proprietary obscure one – to increase customer
lock-in and increase the investment that competitors
have to make to create compatible products.

## Distinguishing Good From Bad
Why is it that, even in relatively 
competitive  security product markets, 
the bad products tend to drive out the good?
The theory of asymmetric information gives us an
explanation of one of the mechanisms. Consider a used
car market, on which there are 100 good cars (the
‘plums’), worth $3000 each, and 100 rather 
troublesome ones (the ‘lemons’), each of which is worth only
$1000. The vendors know which is which, but the
buyers don’t. So what will be the equilibrium price of
used cars?
If customers start off believing that the probability
they will get a plum is equal to the probability they
will get a lemon, then the market price will start off
at $2000. However, at that price only lemons will be
offered for sale, and once the buyers observe this, the
price will drop rapidly to $1000 with no plums being
sold at all. In other words, when buyers don’t have as
much information about the quality of the products
as sellers do, there will be severe downward pressure
on both price and quality. Infosec people frequently
complain about this in many markets for the products 
and components we use; the above insight, due
to Akerlof, explains why it happens

The problem of bad products driving out good ones
can be made even worse when the people evaluating 
them aren’t the people who suffer when they fail.
Much has been written on the ways in which corporate 
performance can be adversely affected when executives 
have incentives at odds with the welfare of their
employer. For example, managers often buy products
and services which they know to be suboptimal or even
defective, but which are from big name suppliers. This
is known to minimize the likelihood of getting fired
when things go wrong. Corporate lawyers don’t condemn 
this as fraud, but praise it as ‘due diligence’.
Over the last decade of the twentieth century, many
businesses have sought to fix this problem by extending 
stock options to ever more employees. However,
these incentives don’t appear to be enough to ensure
prudent practice by security managers.

## Conclusion
Much has been written on the failure of informa-
tion security mechanisms to protect end users from
privacy violations and fraud. This misses the point.
The real driving forces behind security system design
usually have nothing to do with such altruistic goals.
They are much more likely to be the desire to grab a
monopoly, to charge different prices to different users
for essentially the same service, and to dump risk. Of-
ten this is perfectly rational.
